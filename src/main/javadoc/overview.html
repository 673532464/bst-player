        BST Player API makes adding Windows Media Player, QuickTime player and Flash player
        plugins to GWT Applications much natural like other GWT widgets.

        <p>
            The API also features classes to facilitate custom HTML based players much like
            media player skins.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            To use the API in GWT applications, add the library to the application classpath and
            inherit the <code>com.bramosystems.gwt.player.BSTPlayer</code> module in your module
            definition.
